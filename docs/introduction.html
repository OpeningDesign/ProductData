<p>The digital transformation of the construction industry fully interests the production chain of construction involving related activities as manufacturing, certification, promotion, marketing, procurement, selection, supply, transportation, transformation, assembly, installation, maintenance and replacement over the time. Effective digital dialogues between these activities should overcome the current exchange traditionally based on documentation, no matter if printed or digital, which for the most cases is not digitally interpretable. The supply chain of construction needs a complete digitalization of information transactions sharing data and construction objects characteristics. Hopefully, the above-mentioned supply chain should comply to the digital standards conventionally used in the design, construction and maintenance stages.
The smart transport of construction objects data needs a clear and common understanding of the format to express the structure and the data. The data can be transferred in several ways, e.g. via direct database connect, or via webservices or file transfer. In all cases, the sender and the receiver of the digital data need a basic standard to implement the data transfer.</p>
<p>Digital models and other information containers, functional to the construction world, need to be read and nurtured, both in input and output, using a suitable, standardized and accepted digital syntax. This will grant the modernization and automatization of dialogues that will eventually and gradually evolve into the so-called machine-to-machine transactions. This standard contains of two parts.</p>
<p>The Part 1 includes basic structures, that are reusable also by Part 2 (shared elements) and defines the basic structure for construction object exchange, as a list of types and instances. The Part 2 includes the structures that are used to express requirement requests and responses as declarative expressions.
The following not exhaustive list of purposes is identified in the context of digital construction object data exchange:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed digital description of a construction object
In order to identify and understand the function of a digital object, a technical description is needed. This standard allows the exchange of descriptions, technical and business properties, geometry, information like pictures and mounting instructions in a digital data sheet. This digital object description could be used for design, specification, quotation processes that converge toward Asset Information Models.</li>
</ul>
<p>-Preparation of bills of quantity
Digitalization during the exchange process promotes predisposition of bills of quantities related to construction products. Structured exchange formats allow a better understanding and advanced search options of the digital properties.</p>
<p>-Procurement and purchase
The digital description of properties with standardized structure makes searches in catalogues easier and automatable. It’s granted the possibility to query construction object properties across digital marketplace. The purchase of products is more reliable if features and performances are digitally available.</p>
<ul>
<li>Construction site management (Logistic)
During construction phases, site managers assure daily operations to keep the construction project on time and on budget. They also manage quality controls and the correspondence between built progresses and design’s prescriptions. All players operating on site, both supervisors and contractors, exchange data related to products. All digital data related to construction products are variously demanded: technical specification, purchase orders, installation procedures, compliance with standards, checklists, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>-As Built design and handover
Exchanging data through a digital schema allow handling the importation in Asset Information Models of all kinds of properties required during advanced design stages or the handover. Informative models are digitally enriched with data related to spare parts, maintenance, onsite installing procedures, Declarations of Performance, etc.</p>
<p>-Safety and risk management
Safety management has impacts on most construction operations: quality control, scheduling, cost control/budgeting and installations procedures. During all these phases, operators interact exchanging required documents in conformity to standards and regulations. On the construction site, however, the Health, Safety and Environment Coordinator deals with construction object like products, tools and machines, work equipment, safety life lines and harnesses, lifting ropes, scaffoldings, cranes etc. Presence on site of such tools involves exchange of data and information actually only partially digitalized: operation and maintenance manuals, periodic checks, authorizations and, sometimes, structural validation.</p>
<p>-Exchange of digital product declaration</p>
<p>Exchange formats improve transport and interpretation of some documentation required according to regulations for construction products. Examples of digitally structured documents are:
•	DoP: Declaration of Performance, reporting the essential characteristics of construction product under the Construction Product Regulation (CPR) 305/2011
•	DoC: Declaration of Conformity for the legal conformity of construction product in terms of health and safety requirements
•	EPD: Environmental Product Declaration defining all products’ environmental information according to ISO 14025:2006.</p>
<p>-Manufacturers digital information exchange (independent online markets)
Manufacturers online products’ catalogues provide all kinds of data through their website, expressing and exchanging machine interpretable information. Digital formats ensure interoperability and a single data structure, avoiding data redundancy. Important catalogues features are data consistency and possibility to store structured Data Sheets in external servers.</p>
<p>-Contract/design requirements checking
Requirements check of digital construction objects characteristics against design properties is handle by a comparison of both digital data sheets produced or obtained during different project phases. Comparison is managed on object or property level through software applications.</p>
