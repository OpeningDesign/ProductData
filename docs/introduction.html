      <h1 class="std">Introduction</h1>
<p>The digital transformation of the construction industry fully interests the production chain of construction involving related activities as manufacturing, certification, promotion, marketing, procurement, selection, supply, transportation, transformation, assembly, installation, maintenance and replacement over the time. Effective digital dialogues between these activities overcomes the current exchange traditionally based on documentation, no matter if printed or digital, which for the most cases is not digitally interpretable.</p>
<p>The supply chain of construction needs a complete digitalization of information transactions sharing data and construction objects characteristics. The digital supply chain shall comply to the standards used in the design, construction and maintenance stages.</p>
<p>The smart transport of construction objects data needs a clear and common understanding of the format to express the structure and the data. The data can be transported in several ways, e.g. via direct database connect, or via webservices or file transfer. In all cases, the sender and the receiver of the digital data need a standard to implement import and export of data.</p>
<p>This standard defines the format for the exchange of construction objects data, based on the EN ISO 16739-1:2018 and contains of two parts. The Part 1 defines formats for the exchange of data templates, catalogues of configured construction objects and construction data. The Part 1 includes basic structures, that are reusable also by Part 2 (shared elements). The Part 2 includes the structures that are used to express requirement requests and responses as declarative expressions.</p>
<p>The following not exhaustive list of purposes is identified in the context of digital construction object data exchange:</p>
<h4>Detailed digital description of a construction object</h4>
<p>In order to identify and understand the function of a construction object, a technical description is needed. This standard allows the exchange of descriptions, technical and business properties, geometry, information like pictures and mounting instructions in a digital data structure. This digital object description is used for design, specification, quotation processes that converge toward Asset Information Models.</p>
<h4>Procurement and purchase</h4>
<p>The digital description of construction objects, based on properties with standardized structures,  makes searches in catalogues easier and automatable. It’s granted the possibility to query construction object properties across digital marketplace. The purchase of products is more reliable if features and performances are digitally available.</p>
<h4>Construction site management (Logistic)</h4>
<p>During construction phases, site managers assure daily operations to keep the construction project on time and on budget. They also manage quality controls and the correspondence between built progresses and design’s prescriptions. All players operating on site, both supervisors and contractors, exchange data related to construction objects (e.g. products) that are installed into the buildings. All digital data related to construction objects are variously demanded (e.g.  technical specification, purchase orders, installation procedures, compliance with standards, checklists, etc.) and can be exchanged according to this standard between the stakeholders.</p>
<h4>Handover to facilities management</h4>
<p>Exchanging data through a digital schema allows the importation of construction objects into Asset Information Models. The models are herby digitally enriched with data related to spare parts, maintenance, onsite installing procedures, Declarations of Performance, etc.</p>
<h4>Safety and risk management</h4>
<p>Safety management has impacts on most construction operations: quality control, scheduling, cost control/budgeting and installations procedures. During all these phases, operators interact exchanging required documents in conformity to standards and regulations. On the construction site, however, the Health, Safety and Environment Coordinator deals with construction object like products, tools and machines, work equipment, safety lifelines and harnesses, lifting ropes, scaffoldings, cranes etc.</p>
<h4>Exchange of digital product declaration</h4>
<p>Exchange formats improve transport and interpretation of some documentation required according to regulations for construction products. Examples of digitally structured documents are:</p>
<ul>
<li>DoP: Declaration of Performance, reporting the essential characteristics of construction product under the Construction Product Regulation (CPR) 305/2011</li>
<li>DoC: Declaration of Conformity for the legal conformity of construction product in terms of health and safety requirements</li>
<li>EPD: Environmental Product Declaration defining all products’ environmental information according to ISO 14025:2006.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Online platforms for construction objects</h4>
<p>Manufacturers online products’ catalogues provide all kinds of data through their websites, expressing and exchanging machine interpretable information. Digital formats ensure interoperability and a single data structure, avoiding data redundancy.</p>
