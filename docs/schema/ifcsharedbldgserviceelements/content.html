<h3 class="std">6.2.1 Schema Definition</h3>
<p>The <i>IfcSharedBldgServiceElements</i> schema in the interoperability layer defines basic concepts required for interoperability primarily between Building Service domain extensions, notably <i>IfcHvacDomain</i>, <i>IfcPlumbingFireProtectionDomain</i>, <i>IfcElectricalDomain</i> and <i>IfcBuildingControlsDomain</i>. This schema includes concepts such as basic type and occurrence definitions for flow and distribution systems and property sets for common building service scenarios such as fluid-flow properties, electrical properties, and space thermal properties.</p>
<p>Figure 45 illustrates the concepts of type, occurrence and performance. Types are specializations of <i>IfcDistributionElementType</i> while occurrences are specializations of <i>IfcDistributionElement</i>. A third theme, defined in the <i>IfcControlExtension</i> schema, relates to the performance characteristics of an occurrence using instances of the <i>IfcPerformanceHistory</i> entity.</p>
<p>A type can have zero or many occurrences. Each occurrence can have many performance history entities associated with it, allowing data that is specific to a certain phase of the lifecycle to be captured and maintained throughout the life of the dataset.</p>
<p><table><tr><td style="width: 600px"><img src="../../../figures/ifcdistributionport_conceptslide2.gif" alt="&quot;type, occurrence and performance history concepts&quot;" title="Figure 45 &mdash; Building service lifecycle"></td></tr><tr><td><p class="figure">Figure 45 &mdash; Building service lifecycle</p></td></tr></table></p>
<p>The <i>IfcSharedBldgServiceElements</i> schema specializes building services concepts symmetrically for occurrences and types, with the <i>primary</i> functional role of the entity determining its classification into the following generic concepts:</p>
<p>\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\X\X\\\\\\* \\\\\\*Energy Conversion Device\\\\\\*: a building systems device that converts energy from one form into another such as a boiler (combusting gas to heat water), chiller (using a refrigeration cycle to cool a liquid), or a cooling coil (using the phase-change characteristics of a refrigerant to cool air).
\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\X\X\\\\\\* \\\\\\*Flow Fitting\\\\\\*: a device that is used to interconnect flow segments or other fittings within a distribution system, such as a tee in a ducted system that branches flow into two directions, or a junction box in an electrical distribution system.
\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\X\X\\\\\\* \\\\\\*Flow Segment\\\\\\*: a section of a distribution system, such as a duct, pipe, or conduit.
\\\\\\*ª\X\X\\\\\\* \\\\\\*Flow Terminal\\\\\\*: acts as a terminus or beginning element in a distribution system such as a ceiling register in a ducted air distribution system, a sink in a waste-water system, or a light fixture in an electrical lighting system.
