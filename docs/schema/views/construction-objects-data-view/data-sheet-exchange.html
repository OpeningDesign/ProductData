<h4><a id="data sheet exchange" name="data sheet exchange">1.1.2 Data sheet exchange</a></h4>
<p class="std">
<p>The &quot;Data sheet exchange&quot; describes how data of specific completely defined constructions objects (e.g. building products) can be structured and exchanged. The description of data sheets for construction objects requires that the data templates as defined above have been agreed upon and are applied.</p>
<p>Data Sheets can be extracted from Catalogue of configured construction objects based on the selection.</p>
<p>With data sheets, specific construction objects can be described digitally, e.g. a digital description of concrete, existing, completely defined products (e.g. heating types) or real existing product instances (e.g. heating terminals), based on the agreed data templates. Construction Object Data Sheets contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Descriptive characteristics based on the characteristic definition taken from the Data Templates</li>
<li>Descriptive attached documents and their metadata, such as PDF files, photos and other files with further information</li>
<li>References to one or more classification systems (such as Omniclass or Uniclass, etc.)</li>
</ul>
