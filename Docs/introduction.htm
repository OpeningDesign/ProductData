<p>The digital transformation of the construction industry fully interests the production chain of construction involving related activities as manufacturing, certification, promotion, marketing, procurement, selection, supply, transportation, transformation, assembly, installation, maintenance and replacement over the time.</p>
<p>Moreover, the supply chain of construction needs a complete digitalization of information transactions shearing data and product characteristics. Hopefully, the above-mentioned supply chain should comply to the digital standards conventionally used in the design, construction and maintenance stages.</p>
<p>Both digital models and other information containers, functional to the construction world, need to be read and nurtured, both in input and output, using a suitable, standardized and accepted digital syntax. This will grant the modernization and automatization of dialogues that will eventually and gradually evolve into the so-called machine-to-machine transactions.</p>
<p>This standard contains of two parts.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Part 1 includes basic structures, that are reusable also by Part 2 (shared elements) and defines the basic structure for products as a list of product types and products.</li>
<li>The Part 2 includes the structures that are used to express requirement requests and responses as declarative expressions.</li>
</ul>
